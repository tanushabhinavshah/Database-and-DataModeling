Normalization helps in reducing redundancy and ensures proper consistency in databases. It divides large tables into smaller efficient tables to tackle CRUD anomalies.
If normalization is not done, it may result in 
1. Inconsistent data
2. Inaccurate data 
3. Inefficient storage of data (redundancy) in the database.


Unnormalized Data:

Orders Table: 
Order_ID  Customer_ID     Products
  101	    Rahul	Laptop, Mouse




1NF Form:

Order_Products Table:
Order_ID    Product_Name
   101	    Laptop
   101	    Mouse
   
   
Orders Table: 
Order_ID  Customer_ID 
  101	    Rahul
